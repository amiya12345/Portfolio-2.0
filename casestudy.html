                    Women’s safety has become a matter of prime concern in the present day. There is no resource more potent for growth than women’s empowerment. I, along with some of my batchmates, as a team, took part in a design sprint organized by DesignTab 
                    — The Official Design Club of NIT Rourkela. As a team, we designed an SOS app and product for enhanced women security.

                    As a team, we had participated in the design sprint organized by DesignTab — The Official Design Club of NIT Rourkela. The sprint was held a day after the conduction of a session on The Basics of
                     UX Design and Design Sprint. The allotted problem statement to all the teams was:
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">
                    Design a service/product/app/etc. that should focus on women’s safety. 
                    You are free to choose any specific problem related to the broad genre of problems that exist in this field.

                    For the design sprint, I teamed up with three of my colleagues
                     — <a href="">Smithraj Karna</a>, Sai Swarup Mohanty, and Rama Kushna Behera. Each of us had relative expertise in different fields, thereby creating a diverse group for the sprint.

                  <p>
                    Multiple consecutive team meetings were held to discuss the problem statement. Since Women’s Safety was too broad a topic, we had to focus our attention on any one of the prime issues under this category. Now that we had analyzed the problem,
                     we decided to focus our attention since that would be helpful in case of an emergency(like attack, harassment, accident, etc.)

                  <p>Upon conducting some stakeholder interviews and 
                      numerous team discussions, we were able to understand who would be the primary stakeholder for our solution.
                       After this, we categorized various users with similar traits into different user groups.
